# Portfolio Site

We were tasked with creating a portfolio page using HTML and CSS. I created a navigation bar at the top in the hader with 4 buttons. Each button goes to the corresponding section of the page (except for Resume as this is placeholder for now). The nav buttons all have a mouseover effect which moves the color gradient. 

The first section "About Me" contains placeholder text. The second section contains multiple tiles based on the example provided which do not navigate to anything for now but each has the same mouseover effet as the nav buttons. Finally, the contact section contains placeholder text for the number and email but the github link directs to my github page. 

At the bottom of the page is a picture of me. All of the required criterea has been met (except for criterea requiring deployed applications as we have not created any yet). I have included a screenshot below of the live site.
